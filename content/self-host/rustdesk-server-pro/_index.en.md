#### Manual Installation

Almost the same as [the open source version](https://rustdesk.com/docs/en/self-host/rustdesk-server-oss/install/), but you do not need to run hbbs/hbbr with any arguments. These can be set later in web console.

- `-k _` is set by default
- `-r <server:host>` is not needed any more if the relay server runs on the same machine with hbbs, and you can set multiple relay servers in the web console

#### Ports Required

You need port 21114-21119 TCP and 21116 UDP open, please ensure these ports are setup when you set firewall rules and Docker port mapping.

You should use a proxy like Nginx to deliver this over HTTPS requiring port 443 to be opened.
